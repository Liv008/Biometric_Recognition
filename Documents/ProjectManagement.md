###What will the project achieve?
Development of a secure website where the users are identified using 
biometrics, by face recognition system rather that username and password. 
The system will be written mainly using JavaScript and Node.js. 
An open-source facial recognition system created by Vincent Muhler 
Face-api.js will be used to perform the user identification process. 
Data about users and their biometrics will be stored in a database.


###What are the risks?
-	incorrect user identification and gaining access to the data by unauthorized / unregistered users.
-	denials of service
-	no web camera
-	blurry video from a camera
-   system incorrectly identifies an impostor as an authorized user
-   spoof attacks at the user interface
-   template database leakage



###Implementation plan:
1.	Write a basic website.
2.	Connect the website to a local server.
3.	Write a user-friendly page.
4.	Create a database.
5.	Implement the face recognition system.
6.	Create user login page / window that will ask user for access to the web camera and perform user identification process.
7.	Create user registration page / window that will ask user for access to the web camera, ask user for their personal data, take userâ€™s biometric measurements, and save data to database.
8.	Add login ability to the page
9.	Add logout ability to the page.
10.	Add ability for a user to change their personal data.
11.	Add ability for a user to delete their account/personal data.
